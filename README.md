# Web_Scraping_Python

## Description

This Python program automates the process of extracting product data from an e-commerce website.  Given a URL, the program fetches the HTML content of the page, parses it using BeautifulSoup, and then extracts the desired product information using CSS selectors (or similar methods).  The extracted data is then neatly organized and saved into a CSV file, which can be easily opened and analyzed in spreadsheet software or used for other data processing tasks.  

## Features

* **URL Input:** Takes the URL of the e-commerce product page as input. 🔗

* **HTML Fetching:** Uses the `requests` library (or similar) to retrieve the HTML content of the page. 🌐

* **HTML Parsing:** Employs BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML structure of the page. 📖

* **Data Extraction:** Extracts product information  using CSS selectors or other appropriate methods.  🔍

* **Data Storage:** Stores the extracted data in a structured format (list of dictionaries, etc.). 🗄️

* **CSV Output:** Writes the extracted data to a CSV file (`product_data.csv`).  📝

* **Customizable Selectors:**  Easy to adjust the CSS selectors in the code to target specific elements on different e-commerce websites. 🛠️

## Technologies Used
